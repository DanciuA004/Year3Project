# Final Year Project

#### The primary aim of this project is 
to design and implement a game-playing program using the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, evaluating its effectiveness through experimental analysis. The AI opponent will play Connect4 against real players, it should be able to showcase the decision-making capabilities of the algorithm well and be a good opponent.

#### Early objectives include creating proof-of-concept programs. 
One of these will be to solve bandit problems using Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods and compare these strategies with naive approaches. This comes into play in the simulation section of MCTS, where the issue at hand looks a lot like a bandit problem, UCB can be implemented in this section to explore the unsure parts of the tree and return the best arm. 
Another proof of concept is a basic Connect4 game that allows two human players to play the game.
