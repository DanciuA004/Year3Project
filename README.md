# Final Year Project

#### The primary aim of this project is 
 to design and implement a game-playing program using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The game I have decided to implement using the MCTS is Connect4; Connect4 is a two-player strategy board game where players take turns dropping coloured discs into a grid to be the first to get four in a row.
